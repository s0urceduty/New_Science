These **20** science subjects represent a visionary taxonomy of interdisciplinary fields designed to push the boundaries of traditional scientific domains. Rooted in computational modeling, theoretical physics, synthetic biology, and cybernetic systems, these subjects introduce radical frameworks for understanding matter, energy, intelligence, and social dynamics. At the core are the computational disciplines, such as Computational Atomics, Computational Hyperchemistry, and Computational Quantum Topology, which aim to simulate and manipulate atomic, molecular, and quantum phenomena through programmable logic and advanced mathematical architectures. Computational Chronophysics and its offshoot, Computational Chronoreactors, extend this logic into time-based systems, where time is treated not merely as a dimension but as a field to be modeled, controlled, and potentially engineered. Similarly, Computational Cyberdynamics and Computational Sociodynamics embed digital models into real-world social or biomechanical contexts, enabling predictive and adaptive frameworks for human behavior and machine interaction.

Simultaneously, a separate yet interconnected axis explores energy transformation and physical reactor systems through subjects like Electrohydrodynamic Reactors, Electrophysics Reactors, and Computational Electrofusion. These subjects delve into the mechanics of energy flow, plasma dynamics, and high-voltage interactions, combining natural analogs like fulgurites with engineered technologies like arc welding. Innovations such as Biomechanical Logic and Quantum Neurogenetics offer new interpretations of cognition, bodily function, and neurological development, merging biology with quantum theory and mechanical computation. Meanwhile, systems like File Farming and Systematic Aerologics propose speculative but structured approaches to information growth and atmospheric analytics, showcasing how digital and physical realms can be harmonized. The culminating subject, Xenodynamics, explores the meta-structure of dynamical systems themselves, with its subfield Quantum Xenodynamics proposing entirely new paradigms for observing and intervening in exotic, non-Euclidean dynamic environments. Altogether, the Sourceduty framework stands as a bold intellectual synthesis, aspiring to unify disparate sciences under a scalable, computationally driven ethos.
